## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is designed to help manage the following:
- Departments and their details
- Employees and their details, including contact information and hire dates
- Relationships between employees and departments

## Database Schema
The database schema is defined in the `schema.sql` file. It includes the following tables:
- `departments`: Stores information about departments.
- `employees`: Stores information about employees.

## Python Scripts
The `employee_management.py` file contains Python scripts to interact with the database. These scripts include functions to:
- Create new departments and employees
- Read employee data
- Update employee data
- Delete employee data

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee_management.git
    cd employee_management
    ```

2. **Set up the database**
    - Create a PostgreSQL database named `employee_management`.
    - Execute the `schema.sql` file to create the tables.
    ```sh
    createdb employee_management
    psql -d employee_management -f schema.sql
    ```

3. **Set up the Python environment**
    - Create a virtual environment and install required packages.
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

4. **Run the Python scripts**
    - Execute the Python script to perform CRUD operations.
    ```sh
    python employee_management.py
    ```

## Optional Enhancements
- Implement stored procedures for common operations.
- Create views for complex queries.
- Develop a simple web interface to interact with the database.
- Add additional tables and relationships, such as project assignments or performance reviews.
